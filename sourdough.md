# Le Sourdough

This is where everything starts. You will create life, and in return life will
give you gluten-based refined bakeries. And you will see that it is good.

## A few basics before getting started

You will need few things to make sourdough. In terms of ingredients, plain flour
and water, and in terms of utensils just a small glass jar (e.g. a jam jar) and
a wooden spoon small enough to stir and scrap its content.

The sourdough is essentially a settlement of alive bacteria, and as such it
doesn't like very much what we use on a daily basis to get rid off bacteria. So
you'll need to take a few precaution:

* Never wash any of your sourdough utensils with soap or washing liquid, use
only hot water. This includes the sourdough glass jar and the wooden spoon you
use to stir.
* Prefer to use mineral or filtrated water.
* They also need to breathe: unless mentioned otherwise, do not close the jar
hermetically. Rather, just put its lid on top of it.
* The sourdough doesn't strive when it's cold. This at times can be an
advantage (more on that later), but generally, keep the jar in a temperate
place.

## Bootstrapping the sourdough

Let's get started! It's dead simple.

1. Mix together in the jar about 100 gr of flour and 100 gr of water. Stir
vigorously using the spoon.
2. Put the lid on the jar and leave it alone until it starts bubbling. It should
take about three days; if nothing happen then start again, but this time add a
teaspoon of sugar to the mixture.
3. Congratulations, your sourdough is born. You should name it.

Now, you'll have to feed your sourdough to keep it alive.

## Feeding your sourdough

### Proportions
The base rule is that for *x* grams of sourdough, you have to add *x* grams of
water and *x* grams of flour. This essential thing is that the sourdough should
be neither solid nor liquid, a bit in between. Stir using the wooden spoon, and
put back the lid on the jar.

### Size does matter
You can see that if you just do that you'll quickly run into a size problem (not
to mention supply chain headaches). That why when feeding the sourdough, you
should be keeping just a portion of it and put the rest aside.

### When should I feed the sourdough?
It depends. Just after your sourdough is born, it is recommended to feed it
twice a day during three days, to kick things off.

When the sourdough is at cruising speed and living in a temperate room, it is
recommended to feed it once a day.

If you put the sourdough in a fridge, it will go into low-power mode and will
live off its last meal for weeks. But this time, close the jar hermetically.

## Using your sourdough

If you want to execute a recipe stating that you need a given weight of
sourdough, you should prepare it a few hours before actually doing the recipe.

You know how to calculate the need weight of sourdough, flour and water to
obtain the final weight of sourdough. You should mix them a few hours before
doing the recipe. As a rule of thumb, the mixture should have doubled in volume
when you'll be using it. I found that the minimum time was wildly dependant on
the room's temperature, but that waiting half a day was just fine.

For instance: on the morning, where you usually feed your sourdough, instead of
throwing away the excess, put in a bowl and feed it the same way your feeding
the resident sourdough. Then when going back from work in the evening, it will
be ready for whatever use you want to make of it.

## Don't fret too much.

Just like the honey badger, the sourdough doesn't care. Once it's alive and
kicking, if you forget about feeding it one or two days, it will just start
being a bit smelly. It's okay, it can happen to the best of us. Stir it, feed
it, and it'll be on the tracks right again.

Similarly, no need to be gram-precise when feeding it. It's more about the
texture of it - and there too the sourdough will happily accommodate a range
going from solid to liquid (*almost*, in both extreme).

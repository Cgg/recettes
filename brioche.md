# La Brioche

If you liked [bread](pain.html), you're going to love brioche.


## Ingredients

* 250 g of fresh and active sourdough
* 610 g of flour
* 150 g of sugar
* 200 mL of fresh, full fat milk
* 50 g of butter, melted
* 2 eggs (plus one for the glazing right before cooking)
* 15g of salt


## Making the brioche in three steps

The making of brioche is split in three steps, separated by proofing times.


### Ingredient mixing & kneading, *autolyse*, 1st proofing

This bit is similar to what you'd do for bread. Mix everything **but the salt**
in a big enough bowl and mix it for just one or two minutes, just to mix the
ingredients together. Then put some cover on the bowl and let it rest for 20 to
40 minutes. This first short wait is called *autolyse* and that's when the
sourdough starts working and linking with the other ingredients.


Then it's time to properly knead the dough. Spill it on a clean work plan,
flatten it a bit and add the salt in the middle. Put on a long tune and slap and
fold the dough for ten minutes. You will see the texture gradually going from
quite rough to quite slick; the dough will also become more and more elastic as
you knead it. You will probably find the dough easier to work with from the
beginning than bread dough (which starts quite sticky and liquid), due to the
presence of butter and eggs in the mix.


Once you're done with kneading, fold the dough in a sort of ball and put it back
in its bowl. Stick some cling film on it and let it wait in the fridge for the
first proofing time. 5h seem to be a minimum but the longer the better (I've
tried up to 12h without any problem).


### Brioche shaping, 2nd proofing

Spill the dough on your work plan and shape it to your fantasy. Arrange the
shaped brioches so that you can put them in the oven easily later on, eg put
them on a baking paper sheet or on a tray directly. (That's because each
additional manipulation just before cooking will increase the risk of deflating
the dough).

*Coming soon: brioche shaping ideas*

Cover the shaped brioches with cling film or some clothe and let them proof
again. This proofing is longer. 6 hours is really the lowest limit and I've
tried up to 15 hours on occasions (the resulting brioche had more volume and
felt softer and lighter).


### Glazing & Cooking

Turn on the oven and set it to 160C. While it is heating up, mix the remaining
egg with a few grains of salt and glaze the brioches. Put them in the oven and
let them cook. The cooking time is dependent on the brioches' volumes. If you've
done two with this recipe, a good guess is probably 25 to 30 minutes.

Some advices:

* Ovens are generally hotter at the back so it may be a good idea to rotate the
tray *en route* if you spot an area browner than the other.
* Stick a knife in the brioche to determine if its core is properly cooked or if
it needs additional time. It should come out clean.
* If the brioches are getting too brown but still raw at their cores, cover them
up with a sheet of aluminium foil.

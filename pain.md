# Le Pain

Picture yourself a Frenchman alienated in London for an unknown period of time.
Good bread is hard to come by and stupidly expensive (okay, not *that* hard, but
still expensive). On the other hand, cooking sourdough bread all by yourself
will fill you with undeniable pride and provide a true sense of self-achievement.

## Ingredients

The secret of a good bread dough resides in these weight proportions: **1, 2,
3**.  Memorize them and you'll be able cook bread for yourself or for a 40-guest banquet.

* 1 unit of sourdough
* 2 units of mineral or filtered water
* 3 units of flour (obviously not self-raising)
* And of course salt (roughly 10g per kilogram of dough)

Experiements demonstrated that 200g of sourdough is a good base, as it will
give you enough material to work with.

## Making the dough

### *Autolyse*

First, put all the ingredients **but the salt** in a big bowl, and stir with a
spoon just long enough to allow everything to be coarsely mixed. Put a wet
towel on top of the bowl and leave it for 20~40 minutes. During this first phase
called *autolyse*, the sourdough will start bonding with the flour and water,
without being hindered by the salt.

### Slap and Fold

Then it's time to knead the dough. Spill the mix on a clean and solid surface,
flatten it and put the salt on the middle. Then play a long song or a short
series episode and repeatedly follow these steps:

* Fold the dough over itself in one direction, squashing it *gently* in the
process
* Fold it again in the perpendicular direction

From time to time, lift the ball of dough completely from the work surface, and
slap it back on the table firmly (don't hold yourself - the sound has to be reminiscent
of the one of spanking).

As you fold and slap the dough more and more, you will notice that its texture
is changing. It will hold itself together better, and will become less sticky
and more elastic. This is what we are after.

### Raises

Once we're there, make a nice ball shape on the work plan, clean around it and
cover it with a wet towel.

Twice, leave it for 1-2 hours and fold it 5 or 6 times (using your hands, or
better yet a dough scraper). Put the wet towel back on in between. These
additional folding steps will help develop better taste and texture for the
crumb.

After that, put the wet towel back on and leave the dough for the final raise.
It should last for at least 4 hours, but it is no problem to extend
it to 6-8 hours.

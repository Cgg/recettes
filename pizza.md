# La Pizza

Using sourdough instead of regular dry yeast not only ensures a vast improvement in taste, but is also the occasion to bring your pizza dough to life, to get started with the obscure sourdough cult, and to be a proper organically-grown pizza hipster with a mustache and a fixie.

## Dough

For one standard size dough:

* 150g sourdough
* 125cl water (Brita the crap out of it otherwise it's no hype)
* 250g flour
* Big pinch o'salt

Put the ingredients in a bowl, mold hard, fold on itself repeatedly until you can shape it as a sphere. Don't hesitate to add flour if the dough is too liquid or sticks to your hands.

Place under the bowl for a couple of hours in a warm place. This time is called "*pointage*."

## Recipes

#### Reina

* Tomatoes
* Mushrooms
* Prosciutto, parma ham (anything Italian and expensive)
* Mozzarella (cooking mozza, rectangular and dry)
* Grated parmesan
* Olive oil (expensive one, please)
* Basil (home-grown)

You've got to make your own tomato sauce, otherwise you're better off buying a frozen pizza at Lidl. The simplest way to up your tomato sauce game is to cut the tomatoes and slowly cook them. Give the sauce a stir every 15 minutes, add olive oil, black pepper, salt. That will take you a couple of hours, but your dough's rising anyway.

Put the tomato sauce on the dough, then add the cubes of mozza on top, on all the surface. Slice the mushrooms and throw that on top, then add the ham. The parmesan comes last.

Heat the oven as much as you can while you do this. It'll never be hot enough to cook your pizza properly anyway.

Pro-tip: put some olive oil on your fresh basil leaves before you cook your pizza in the oven, otherwise they'll burn.

Cook the thing. Add a drizzle of olive oil. Eat the pizza.

#### Caprese

* Mozzarella di Bufala
* Cherry tomatoes
* Olive oil
* Balsamic vinegar

Spread some olive oil on your dough, and add on top the slices of mozza.

In between slices of mozza, you will add cut-in-half tomatoes. Drizzle some more olive oil, and cook in the oven until it doesn't look all liquid on top.

Drizzle a large stream of balsamic vinegar on top when taking the pizza out of the oven. Eat the pizza. Don't burn yourself.
